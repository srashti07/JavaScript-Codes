### Challenge 3 - Know Your Lucky Number

#### Problem Statement

As per a numerology logic, a person's lucky number is the single digit sum calculated from their birthdate.​

For example, if the birthdate is 05312022, the lucky Number is: ​

    05312022 --> 0 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 15

    15 --> 1 + 5 = 6​

    the lucky number is **6**.​

Write a JavaScript program that calculates ​the single digit sum for the given date ​value.​

The solution for this challenge should be written in `c3-submission.js` file.

The file is located inside the folder `c3-lucky-number`.

##### Tasks

- Using appropriate JavaScript loop constructs and calculate single digit sum for the date 31st May 2022​
- The date should be stored as string in `mmddyyyy` format.​
- The program should generate following output:

    ```
    Your lucky number is 6​
    ```

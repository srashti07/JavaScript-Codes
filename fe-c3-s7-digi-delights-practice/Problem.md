### Problem Statement
 
Create a web page named DigiDelights that offers an engaging experience for users interested in exploring interesting number trivia. Users should be able to input a number, and the application should fetch captivating facts about that number from the `http://numbersapi.com/{number}` API. When the user enters a date in the mm/dd format, the application should fetch captivating facts about that date from the `http://numbersapi.com/{month}/{date}/date` API Moreover, users should have the ability to save their preferred trivia tidbits in a JSON format via the `http://localhost:3000/trivia` API for later access.

To promote a sense of community and enjoyable learning, users must be able to access a collection of saved trivia entries contributed by others, displayed in a user-friendly and interactive format. The goal is to build a frontend web application, as exemplified by the provided HTML and JavaScript code, that fulfills these objectives while delivering a delightful user experience for those keen on uncovering the intriguing universe of numbers.

To ensure responsiveness on various devices, incorporate a header and footer, and leverage the Bootstrap framework for this purpose.

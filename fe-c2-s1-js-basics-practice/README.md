## Practice

This sprint has 4 practices.

### Problem Statements

#### Practice 1 - Find the Largest Number​

Find the Largest Number from the three unique numbers​ using:
- nested if  ​
- ternary operator  ​

The solution for this exercise should be provided in `p1-submission.js` file.

The file is located inside the folder `p1-find-the-largest-number`.

Refer to the table given below for different numbers and the expected largest number:

   Number 1 | Number 2 | Number 3 | Largest Number |
   |-|-|-|-| 
   30 |  50 |  45 | 50
   -20 | -15 | -10 | -10
   23 | 18 | 20 | 23
   75 | 65 | 55 | 75
   82 | 62 | 92 | 92

For the given values, both the methods should generate the same output.

#### Practice 2 - Count Days for a Given Month and Year​

Write a program that checks the month and year value and prints the number of days in that month. 

Test the logic for the following values of month and year:​

   | Month​ | Year​ |
   | ------| ---- |
   | 2​     | 2008​ |
   | 2​     | 2009​ |
   | 1​     | 2009​ |
   | 11​    | 2009​ |

For example, if month = 2 and year = 2008,

```
Output: No. of days 29
```

Note​:
- 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 12th month have 31 days.​
- 4th, 6th, 9th, and 11th month have 30 days.​
- 2nd month has 28 days, except the leap year, that has 29 days.​
   - A leap year occurs every 4 years, e.g., 2004, 2008, 2012 and so on.​
   - However, a century year is a leap year only if it comes after every 400 years, 
      - eg. 1200, 1600, 2000 and so on.​
   - So, a year is a leap year if it is: ​
      - Divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100​
      - Or divisible by 400

The solution for this exercise should be provided in `p2-submission.js` file.

The file is located inside the folder `p2-day-count`.

#### Practice 3 - Print first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series​

Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci Series.

```
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
```

**Note:** Fibonacci numbers form a sequence of numbers where every number is the sum of the preceding two numbers. The first 2 values are 0 and 1 and their sum is 1 which is the next number in the sequence.​
0,1,1,2,3,5...​

Provide the solution for this exercise in `p3-submission.js` file. 

The file is located inside the folder `p3-fibonacci-first-10`.

#### Practice 4 - Calculate the Sum of Digits of a Number 

Calculate sum of digits of number 4386.

4386 --> 4 + 3 + 8 + 6 = 21

Provide the solution for this exercise in `p4-submission.js` file. 

The file is located inside the folder `p4-sum-of-digits`.

```
Output: Sum of Digits of 4386 = 21
```
